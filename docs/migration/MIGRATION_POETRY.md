# Poetry Migration Summary

This document describes the migration from traditional setuptools/pip to Poetry for the LMDB SortedSet library.

## Migration Date

October 4, 2025

## What Changed

### 1. Package Configuration

**Before (setup.py):**
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="lmdb-sortedset",
    version="0.1.0",
    install_requires=["lmdb>=1.4.0"],
    extras_require={"dev": ["pytest>=7.0.0", ...]},
    ...
)
```

**After (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "lmdb-sortedset"
version = "0.1.0"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
lmdb = "^1.4.0"

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
...

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

### 2. Dependency Management

**Before:**
- `requirements.txt` - Production dependencies
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
- Manual version pinning

**After:**
- `pyproject.toml` - All dependencies in one file
- `poetry.lock` - Auto-generated lockfile for reproducible builds
- Semantic versioning with `^` operator
- Dependency groups for better organization

### 3. Installation Commands

| Task | Before (pip) | After (Poetry) |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Install | `pip install -e .` | `poetry install` |
| Install dev | `pip install -e ".[dev]"` | `poetry install` (includes dev by default) |
| Install prod only | `pip install .` | `poetry install --only main` |
| Add dependency | Edit requirements.txt + pip install | `poetry add package` |
| Remove dependency | Edit requirements.txt + pip uninstall | `poetry remove package` |

### 4. Running Commands

| Task | Before (pip) | After (Poetry) |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| Run script | `python script.py` | `poetry run python script.py` |
| Run tests | `pytest` | `poetry run pytest` |
| Enter shell | `source venv/bin/activate` | `poetry shell` |
| Build package | `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` | `poetry build` |
| Publish | `twine upload dist/*` | `poetry publish` |

### 5. Makefile Updates

**Before:**
```makefile
install:
    pip install -e .

test:
    pytest -v
```

**After:**
```makefile
install:
    poetry install --only main

test:
    poetry run pytest -v
```

### 6. File Changes

#### New Files Created:
- `POETRY_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive Poetry usage guide
- `INSTALL.md` - Installation guide for both Poetry and pip
- `MIGRATION_POETRY.md` - This file

#### Modified Files:
- `pyproject.toml` - Converted to Poetry format
- `setup.py` - Reduced to minimal compatibility wrapper
- `Makefile` - Updated all commands to use Poetry
- `README.md` - Updated installation instructions
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Added Poetry commands
- `SUMMARY.md` - Reflected Poetry migration
- `.gitignore` - Added Poetry-specific entries

#### Preserved Files (for backward compatibility):
- `requirements.txt` - Can still be used with pip
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Can still be used with pip
- `setup.py` - Minimal wrapper for pip compatibility

## Benefits of Poetry

### 1. Better Dependency Resolution
- Automatic resolution of dependency conflicts
- Deterministic builds with poetry.lock
- Clear dependency tree visualization

### 2. Simplified Workflow
```bash
# Old way
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# New way
poetry install
```

### 3. Virtual Environment Management
```bash
# Poetry handles venv automatically
poetry install  # Creates venv if needed
poetry shell    # Activates venv
poetry run cmd  # Runs in venv without activation
```

### 4. Semantic Versioning
```toml
# Flexible version constraints
lmdb = "^1.4.0"  # >=1.4.0, <2.0.0
pytest = "^7.0.0"  # >=7.0.0, <8.0.0
```

### 5. Development Experience
```bash
# Add dependency
poetry add requests  # Updates pyproject.toml and installs

# Update dependencies
poetry update  # Updates all to latest compatible versions

# Show outdated
poetry show --outdated  # Check for updates
```

## Migration Steps Performed

1. ✅ Converted `pyproject.toml` to Poetry format
2. ✅ Added Poetry sections: `[tool.poetry]`, `[tool.poetry.dependencies]`, etc.
3. ✅ Moved dev dependencies to `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`
4. ✅ Updated build-system to use poetry-core
5. ✅ Simplified `setup.py` to minimal wrapper
6. ✅ Updated `Makefile` with Poetry commands
7. ✅ Updated documentation: README, QUICKSTART, SUMMARY
8. ✅ Created comprehensive guides: POETRY_GUIDE.md, INSTALL.md
9. ✅ Updated `.gitignore` for Poetry
10. ✅ Preserved backward compatibility with pip

## Backward Compatibility

The project maintains backward compatibility:

### Still Works with pip:
```bash
# Traditional installation still works
pip install lmdb
pip install -e .

# Or using requirements files
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Why Keep Compatibility?
- Users without Poetry can still use the library
- CI/CD systems that don't support Poetry
- Simple deployments that only need `lmdb`
- Gradual migration path for users

## Testing the Migration

### Verify Poetry Installation Works:
```bash
# Install Poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install project
cd lmdb-sortedset
poetry install

# Run verification
poetry run python verify.py

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Run examples
poetry run python examples/basic_usage.py
```

### Verify pip Installation Still Works:
```bash
# Without Poetry
cd lmdb-sortedset
pip install lmdb
python verify.py
python examples/basic_usage.py
```

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files:
1. **README.md**
   - Added Poetry installation instructions
   - Updated all command examples
   - Added alternative pip commands

2. **QUICKSTART.md**
   - Added Poetry quick start section
   - Updated all code examples
   - Maintained pip compatibility notes

3. **SUMMARY.md**
   - Updated project structure
   - Updated installation section
   - Updated development tools section

4. **New: POETRY_GUIDE.md**
   - Complete Poetry tutorial
   - Command reference
   - Configuration guide
   - Troubleshooting section

5. **New: INSTALL.md**
   - Step-by-step installation for Poetry
   - Step-by-step installation for pip
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Multiple installation options

## Makefile Commands

### New Poetry-enabled commands:
```bash
make install       # poetry install --only main
make install-dev   # poetry install
make test          # poetry run pytest
make format        # poetry run black
make lint          # poetry run flake8 && mypy
make examples      # poetry run python examples/
make build         # poetry build
make shell         # poetry shell
make lock          # poetry lock
make update        # poetry update
```

## Developer Workflow

### Before (pip):
```bash
git clone repo
cd repo
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

### After (Poetry):
```bash
git clone repo
cd repo
poetry install
poetry run pytest
# or
poetry shell
pytest
```

## CI/CD Considerations

### GitHub Actions Example:
```yaml
# Before
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# After
- name: Install Poetry
  uses: snok/install-poetry@v1
- name: Install dependencies
  run: poetry install
```

## Rollback Plan

If Poetry causes issues, rollback is easy:

1. Use the preserved `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
2. Use pip: `pip install -e .`
3. The `setup.py` still works for basic installation
4. All code remains unchanged (only packaging changed)

## Next Steps for Users

### If Using Poetry (Recommended):
1. Install Poetry: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`
2. Install project: `poetry install`
3. Read `POETRY_GUIDE.md` for detailed usage
4. Use `make` commands for convenience

### If Using pip:
1. Install dependency: `pip install lmdb`
2. Or install package: `pip install -e .`
3. Continue using as before
4. Consider migrating to Poetry when convenient

## Conclusion

The migration to Poetry is complete and successful:

✅ Modern dependency management  
✅ Better development workflow  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  
✅ Backward compatibility maintained  
✅ All tests passing  
✅ Examples working  

The project now uses Poetry as the primary package manager while maintaining full backward compatibility with pip for users who prefer traditional tools.

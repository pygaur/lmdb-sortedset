## Core Migration Tasks

### 1. Package Configuration
- [x] Converted `pyproject.toml` to Poetry format
- [x] Added `[tool.poetry]` section with metadata
- [x] Added `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` for production deps
- [x] Added `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` for dev deps
- [x] Updated `[build-system]` to use poetry-core
- [x] Preserved tool configurations (pytest, black, mypy, coverage)

### 2. Dependency Management
- [x] Migrated dependencies to `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Used semantic versioning (`^1.4.0`)
- [x] Separated dev dependencies into groups
- [x] Kept `requirements.txt` for backward compatibility
- [x] Kept `requirements-dev.txt` for backward compatibility

### 3. Build System
- [x] Updated `setup.py` to minimal wrapper
- [x] Set poetry-core as build backend
- [x] Verified package can build with `poetry build`

### 4. Makefile Updates
- [x] Updated `install` to use `poetry install --only main`
- [x] Updated `install-dev` to use `poetry install`
- [x] Updated `test` to use `poetry run pytest`

   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. **Files to restore**:
   - Keep current `requirements.txt`
   - Keep current `setup.py`
   - Revert `Makefile` if needed

3. **Everything still works** because:
   - setup.py is functional
   - requirements.txt preserved
   - No code changes made
